# AGPS_PYT27
Automated GRACE Processing System

Automated GRACE Processing System (AGPS):
AGPS is a system developed by Python that concerns by converting all the defined manual calculations in GRACE Data processing into an automated processing system.

The main parts in AGPS can be listed below:
Automatic Month Index Calculation: User can select the desired working directory and execute this section to generate spreadsheet containing all the months covering the time interval.
Automatic Method for Temporal Mean Calculation and Removal: User can select the desired working directory and execute this section to generate extracted raw datat files and calculate the temporal mean for the GRACE L2 Data and finally remove that mean.
The Modules used in AGPS can be listed below:
GDAL: It is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.
NumPy: It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Tkinter: The Tkinter module ("Tk Interface") is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI Toolkit.
XlsxWwriter: XlsxWriter is a Python module that can be used to write text, numbers, formulas and hyperlinks to multiple worksheets in an Excel 2007+ XLSX file. It supports features such as formatting and many more.
GZip: This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just like the GNU programs gzip and gunzip would.
